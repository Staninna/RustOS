# RustOS

## Motivation

I was a few weeks back interested in how Operation Systems work under the hood so I thought the best way to learn that is to try and make one myself. However, I am not sure if it will ever take off I am fairly new to rust so we will see.

Sooo, This is my attempt to write an Operation System in Rust, As you can see there is not much here yet, but I hope that will change soon.
